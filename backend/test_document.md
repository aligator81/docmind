# Test Document

This is a test document to verify the document processing pipeline.

## Section 1: Introduction
Document processing involves several steps:
- Extraction of text content
- Chunking into manageable pieces
- Creating embeddings for semantic search

## Section 2: Processing Steps
1. **Extraction**: Convert document to plain text
2. **Chunking**: Split text into logical chunks
3. **Embedding**: Create vector representations

## Section 3: Expected Results
After processing, this document should be:
- Searchable by semantic content
- Available for chat interactions
- Properly chunked and embedded

This test document should help verify that the complete processing pipeline is working correctly.
